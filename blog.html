        <p>
            Welcome to the West Hatch Computer Science Society Blog!<br><br>
            As we approach the close of 2024, we reflect on a year of incredible progress, learning, and innovation. This year has been full of exciting breakthroughs in computer science, and we've seen how these developments have shaped our academic community.<br><br>
            Unfortunately, due to some technical challenges, our planned game development project has been put on hold. We are currently facing issues with setting up the correct coding environment, including the installation of Pygame, which is essential for game development. Additionally, our current skill set, and available tools are not yet sufficient to move forward with this project. However, we are committed to overcoming these obstacles and are actively working to resolve them so we can resume the game development initiative as soon as possible.<br><br>
            In the meantime, we are considering alternative activities to keep everyone engaged and learning. We plan to organise workshops, hackathons, and visits to local IT firms to offer hands-on experience and networking opportunities. As we continue to explore computer science, we aim to tailor our sessions to accommodate varying skill levels. For example, today’s session focused on the basics of Python, where we covered fundamental concepts such as print statements, variables, and different punctuation in coding (like brackets and inverted commas). These sessions are designed to help everyone, whether you're new to coding or looking to deepen your understanding, and we will continue alternating our approach to suit the diverse abilities of our members.<br><br>
            As we close out this year, we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to every member, who has been a part of our journey. Your enthusiasm, collaboration, and dedication have been the driving forces behind the success of this society. We look forward to building on this momentum and continuing to support each other in the year to come. <br><br>
            Wishing you all a restful holiday season and a happy new year ahead! Here’s to another year of growth, discovery, and pushing the limits of what we can achieve together!<br><br>

        <h3>"Software is a great combination between artistry and engineering." – Bill Gates</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome back to the world of code!<br><br>
            During a previous session, the concept of providing a secret link for the design team to play the game during its development phase was discussed. This link, which has now been successfully created, enables members to access and play the game directly through a browser, without the need for prior installation. While this approach is useful for external testing, it does not offer functionality for the development team, as it does not support code editing or modifications.<br><br>
            The development team made huge progress in refining the code for the upcoming game, with a primary focus on enhancing its functionality and interactivity. Elena played a key role in guiding members through the intricacies of the game's code, providing clear explanations and hands-on instruction. This included a deep dive into the design and implementation of the NPC data structure, as well as the development of the conversation response tree, which is crucial for the game's dialogue system. Through these collaborative efforts, members gained valuable experience in game development and improved their understanding of the complex coding concepts.<br><br>
            The design team made significant strides in enhancing the user experience by creating interactive text boxes for NPC conversations, ensuring seamless dialogue integration within the game. In addition, they continued to develop captivating PixilArt designs, with a particular focus on capturing the distinct aesthetic of a New York Bar, which added depth and atmosphere to the game’s environment. Furthermore, the team began designing the kitchen room, incorporating detailed elements such as a cook. These efforts collectively contributed to creating a more immersive and visually engaging experience for players, while allowing members to apply and refine their skills in both design and creative development.<br><br>

        <p>
            Happy December, Readers!<br><br>
            As we roll into the final month of the year, the Computer Science Society had an exciting session packed with insightful discussions and hands-on activities, from both the Design and Development Team. Today’s session was a perfect reminder of the power of collaboration and the importance of staying curious in this ever-evolving field.<br><br>
            Following last week's session, the Design Team made great progress on their escape room aesthetics. They successfully completed the PixilArt design of the IRS Headquarters scene, adding exciting details to bring the space to life. To highlight the intergalactic theme, the team chose a space-themed background, blending futuristic elements with the IRS office setting. This unique touch adds an otherworldly feel to the scene, aligning with the game's broader cosmic narrative. Next session, the team will begin to work on a kitchen aesthetic, experimenting with various design elements and setting the stage for an immersive culinary environment. The Design Team is eager to continue building out more rooms, with plans to create scenes like the New York Bar and the Painting Room, further expanding the game’s diverse and imaginative settings.<br><br>
            In addition, members of the Social Media Team proposed an idea to showcase the impressive work being done by members of the Computer Science Society. A LinkedIn post could be created to highlight individual projects, such as creation of an app, as well as contributions in fields like robotics and engineering. This feature would provide recognition for the hard work and creativity of members, while also inspiring others within the community. It’s a great opportunity to celebrate the diverse range of projects and achievements within the society, and this upcoming post promises to be an exciting addition to the Computer Science Society's LinkedIn.<br><br>
            Furthermore, the Development team focused on tasks unrelated to Pygame while awaiting the necessary installations from the IT department. The initial work involved designing algorithms for NPC-related procedures using flowcharts to map out their operations on NPC data. These procedures were then implemented in Python, successfully achieving the desired functionality. This included operations such as linear searches to identify appropriate conversations, as well as a general talkToNPC function to automate NPC interactions and streamline development for future stages. Additionally, the NPC structure was revisited, this time applying Object-Oriented Programming principles to enhance its design.<br><br>

            Hello, fellow tech enthusiasts! What a great turnout this session!<br><br>
            Prior to this week's session, the Social Media Team began to establish the West Hatch Computer Science Society's LinkedIn. This included setting up the LinkedIn profile, as well as informing the network about the current activities of the society. We encourage you to connect with our members and follow our company to find out the latest information, and to find out how you can get involved!<br><br>
            The Website Development Team made some further changes to the website, including creating a new repository and URL changes. However, the team faced some technical issues from the aftermath of the URL, on many different platforms, but this was then resolved.<br><br>
            During today's session, the Design Team focused on creating escape room aesthetics, using PixilArt, designing rooms like the IRS Headquarters and an F1 racetrack; this will be incorporated when the game is fully functioning. Rianna experimented with the F1 racetrack, showcasing a Ferrari Formula 1 Vehicle, with popular driver, Charles Leclerc. Hannah and Emily formed a prototype of the IRS Headquarters, based on the previous mood board, portraying the boss in the head office. The team hopes to continue to design more of the escape rooms, for example, the New York Bar and the Painting Room. <br><br>
            In addition, the Development Team went through the core concepts and subroutines that they will be using throughout the course of development, focusing on how the game could fit on a range of screen sizes. Additionally, members communicated with the Computer Science Department, attempting to get permission for the installation of modern software development tools, such as Visual Studio Code, and the installation of the Pygame dependency, which the text-based escape room relies heavily on.<br><br>
            At the end of the session, all members went through the NPC structure, explaining some of the concepts about object-oriented programming. As well as this, the society had a verbal discussion, regarding the NPC conversation, as a practical exercise to help us understand how the NPC system will work.<br><br>

        <p>
            Whilst computer programming, algorithms, and digital innovation are frequently linked to computer science, the best opportunities for learning can occasionally occur beyond devices and textbooks. This was undoubtedly the matter during the Computer Science Society's recent educational trip, an ice-skating experience that combined joy and teamwork with an understanding of computer science.<br><br>
            Indeed, you've read this precisely! The opportunity for this special educational experience was ice skating, where we learnt that computer science ideas are not limited to the online environment but may be used in unanticipated places. Let's start by discussing the trip's key points and how ice skating provided fresh insights into cooperation and innovation.<br><br>
            The trip encouraged collaboration, communication, and teamwork, all vital in computer science and ice skating, particularly when working in groups to develop complex systems or write code. Our team obtained important lessons about communication (operating effectively and supporting one another to overcome barriers) and synchronisation (reducing errors) from the cooperative nature of ice skating.<br><br>
            Furthermore, the experience reaffirmed the concept that education should not be limited to school environments. Though you might least expect it, often the best learning emerges!<br><br>
            For the Computer Science Society, this beneficial ice-skating trip was an amazing event that gave us new understandings into the ways that computer science affects daily life and taught us important lessons. Whether on the ice or in school, let's keep thinking, inspiring, creating, and gliding forward into the future!<br><br>

            We hope you had a productive half-term break and are ready for another exciting week! Here's your weekly roundup of updates within the Computer Science Society.<br><br>
            Each team had a specific goal for this week. The design team (Emily, Rianna, Hannah and Maxwell) worked on completing the game's Loading Screen. Members started the session by making a mood board, establishing the aesthetic for the game. We decided to use PixilArt to design the front page, focused on the music video of Whenever, Wherever. Inspirations included mountains for the background, a coin alluding to tax evasion, and the ocean to represent the adventurous aspects of the game. The development team (Samuel, Sophia, Natalia, and Elena) fixed bugs in the game window and then they began experimenting with Pygame, including setting up its dependency. <br><br>
            In the future, we hope to complete the design of the Loading Screen, as well as providing functionality to the icons on the screen.<br><br>

        <h3>November 4th, 2024 - By Hannah Javed</h3>
        <h3>"The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before." - Bill Gates</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to the blog of the Computer Science Society! Building an environment around computer science is crucial in the ever-changing technological scene of today; the Computer Science Society is an essential platform for students to think, create and inspire. Check out this week's virtual meeting in more detail!<br><br>
            First, the group discussed whether to develop a single room for the game (e.g. New York Bar, IRS Headquarters, etc), or to develop a more detailed storyline for the game. After considering the duration of the development process and outlining the design of each format, the group decided to focus on one whole room first, which illustrates the backstory for user before the game starts. The backstory starts in IRS Headquarters and then the user is transported to the New York Bar, after interactions with other NPCs.<br><br>
            The members of the society therefore split up into 2 groups: the design team wrote the script for the introduction of the game, whilst the development team started the code for the game.<br><br>
            Members of the design team (Emily, Rianna and Saif) wrote the NPC dialogue for the beginning of the game and outlined key directions for the programmers and voice actors. The dialogue begins with Shakira telling the user that they must meet several characters at the IRS headquarters, in order to find the key to the 59th portal to start the mission. After many encounters, the user is transported to the New York Bar called MacLaurens, where they discover more information about the tax evader and something unexpected occurs!<br><br>
            Members of the development team (Samuel, Harsha, Natalia, Tayyab, Maxwell, Cadan, and Elena) came up with a draft for the data structure, that will be used for NPC conversations with the user. In addition, they created the new GitHub repository for the game, as well as making a blank Tkinter window with a blank slate ready for development.<br><br>
            Thank you for reading West Hatch Computer Science Society's blog. Whether you're currently a member or someone new looking to get involved, we are excited to welcome new members and new ideas.<br><br>
            See you next Monday!<br><br>
            Hannah

        <h3>October 29th, 2024 - By Hannah Javed and Rianna Chirea</h3>
        <h3>“Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn." - Steve Jobs</h3>
        <p>Happy Half-Term Readers!<br><br>

            This week's session was a Virtual Meeting, where members learnt how to use GitHub (cloud based system where users may collaborate with peers to develop software and retain code); this software was also used to build the West Hatch Computer Science Society Website and we have found it a useful online software for our society because it has allowed us to make necessary changes via, especially regarding user interface design, throughout the process.<br><br>
            
            Later in the session, the members of the society were taught the basics of using Tkinter, for example, how to make text display on a user interface, and how to create a button that outputs text on the user interface. We plan to organise further sessions about Tkinter, due to its crucial role within the project.<br><br>

        <h3>October 21st, 2024 - By Hannah Javed, Emily Phan and Rianna Chirea</h3>
        <h3>“Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.” – Donald Knuth</h3>
        <p>Welcome back Readers! Another Monday, another meeting.<br><br>
            This week’s meeting focused on finalising the concept of the game and discussing and
            shortlisting different escape room ideas. The storyline for the text-based escape room revolves
            around a character called Sharika. The gamers will have to travel through different universes,
            which will be presented as carriages in a train. Each carriage will compromise of a different
            theme, for example F1 and a haunted house, and the gamer will have to find clues to travel from
            one carriage to another, to find and arrest the tax evader, who is also traveling on the same train.
            During the final level of the game, the gamer discovers that the tax evader was Sharika, who
            acted as a conductor and worked to sabotage the gamer by misleading them with clues.<br><br>
            The aim of the session was to decide on the different escape room ideas. Therefore, we
            brainstormed escape room proposals, for example, underwater theme, kitchen theme and a
            gallery setting. After condensing the ideas, the group decided to prioritise an idea, that was
            voted most popular, this being the gamer entering a New York City bar, where 3 members of staff
            provide the gamer with 3 clues (1 truth and 2 lies), and the gamer must figure out which member
            of staff is telling the truth. However, before the truth is revealed, each member of staff dies one
            by one, without the truth being revealed. The gamer then finds a key in their drink with a note
            attached; this explains how a predecessor also tried to imprison the tax evader and left a key for
            the gamer, to allow them to travel to the next carriage.<br><br>
            Later in the session, we briefly discussed the themes for the following carriages:<br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Second Carriage – haunted house theme</li>
            <li>Third Carriage – F1 Ferrari themed room</li>
            <li>Fourth Carriage – gallery theme</li>
            <li>Fifth Carriage – kitchen theme</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            The demographic for the text-based game is for a younger audience (teenagers), and of course
            Shakira fans! Do her hips lie??<br><br>
            Thank you for reading West Hatch Computer Science Society’s blog. Whether you’re currently a
            member or someone new looking to get involved, we are excited to welcome new members and
            new ideas.<br><br>
            See you next Monday!<br><br>
Hannah, Emily and Rianna

        <h3>Connecting Minds, Crafting Codes. By Hannah Javed and Emily Phan - October 14, 2024</h3>
        <p>Welcome Readers! We’re excited to kick off this school year with the first Computer
Science Society Meeting! The West Hatch Computer Science Society aims to create a
collaborative environment, providing learning opportunities for pupils and a chance to
showcase knowledge and skills within Computer Science.<br><br>
            
This week, we made a brainstorm of project ideas, including an online time capsule, a
budget management app and a fully functioning doll house; the group shortlisted the
project ideas discussed and voted for the most popular idea. After narrowing the ideas
down to 2 projects, the group compromised by incorporating both key aspects of the
projects to form a single idea.<br><br>
            
The most popular project was creating a text-based escape room, using Tkinter,
proposed by Saif. As part of the compromise, we decided to integrate the theme of
Shakira, which was inspired by the Shakira AI themed assistant, that came second
during voting. Maxwell, a member of the society, shared the idea of the escape room
being based on a detective attempting to catch a criminal, where the user can navigate
through different rooms, using a simple user interface. After discussing the storyline, we
concluded on the idea of the user being a multi-dimensional tax collector, who is
attempting to imprison Shakira, who has committed tax evasion. The name “Wherever,
Whenever” , was suggested by Rianna, which highlights the key idea that the user is able
to travel through different dimensions, to complete tasks and catch the criminal.<br><br>
            
During our next session, which will be conducted via Zoom, we plan to confirm the over-
arching storyline, as well as follow-up on the repeated format for all escape room
scenarios. A further session will be carried out next week, to start preparation for this
exciting project.<br><br>
            
Thank you for reading West Hatch Computer Science Society’s blog. Whether you’re
currently a member or someone new looking to get involved, we are excited to welcome
new members and new ideas.<br><br>
            
See you next week!<br><br>
            
Hannah and Emily</p>
